# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
This is an analysis of the road accident dataset in Kaggle. The main aim of this analysis is to create an interactive dashboard to look at overall data and identify the insights from the dashboard.

## Here are the points I was interested in.
* Primary KPI - Total casualties have taken place after the accident.
* Primary KPIs - Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicles.
* Secondary KPI - Total casualties with respective vehicle types.
* Monthly trends showing a comparison of casualties for the current year and the past year.
* Maximum casualties by road type.
* Distribution of total casualties by road surface.
* Relation between casualties by area/location & day/night.

## I took the following steps to create my analysis & Dashboard
* Downloaded data from the Maven website, conducted cleaning processes and organized it for analytical purposes.
* Utilized pivot tables to structure and summarize the cleaned data, facilitating easy analysis and interpretation.
* Created charts based on the prepared data and arranged them within the dashboard tab for visualization.
* Established slicers to enable interactive filtering across all tables, ensuring seamless data exploration.
* Formatted each section of the dashboard and applied a cohesive theme for a visually appealing and cohesive presentation of insights.

## Here are my key takeaways
* car accidents caused 79.8% of casualties.
* 84% of casualties are slight.
* The year 2021 is the highest number of casualties recorded year compared to 2022.
* Most of the accidents are held in daylight.
* Road type single carriageway and dry surface are  top in the lists of casualties.
* Most of the accidents are held in urban areas.
