* This is a road accident dataset analysis to create an Excel dashboard.
* In this analysis,
     1. I used Power query for data wrangling like deleting unwanted columns, extracting columns from existing columns, formatting, handling missing values, etc
     2. I created pivot tables, pivot visuals, and an interactive dashboard.
* Found insights from an Excel interactive dashboard.
